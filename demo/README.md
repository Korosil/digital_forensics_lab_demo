## In order to be able to execute these files on a LAMP server, you must first edit ```config.php``` and fill in the credentials of  MySQL server that are going to be executed on (e.g. username & password). 
## Otherwise you will not be able to procceed.




### Assuming that you are using a LAMP stack server and as long as the configuration of ```config.php``` file has been completed, you are advised to copy the whole folder under ```/var/www``` directory.
